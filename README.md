# TrySparkAI Website Clone

This repository will house a close reproduction of the public face of [trysparkai.com](https://trysparkai.com/), along with any customizations we need for our own presentation.

## Goals

1. Capture the structure, styling, and content of the live site so we can quickly iterate on features.
2. Document the cloning and customization steps as part of the project board below.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies (stack TBD; feel free to use `bun` if we're building the frontend).
2. Run the local dev server (`bun dev` / equivalent once scaffolding exists).
3. Coordinate further updates via the GitHub project board.
